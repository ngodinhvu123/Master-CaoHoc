'BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in\nthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early\nJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,\nalthough normal humidity levels have not been restored,\nComissaria Smith said in its weekly review.\n    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.\n    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags\nof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\nmln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\narrivals figures.\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\nper tonne FOB.\n    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\n4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\n    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\nat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\n2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\n2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\n    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\nUruguay and open ports.\n    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\nMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\nNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.\n    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\ncurrency areas.\n    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\nand 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\nYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\nSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\nsaid.\n    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\nagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\ncrop.\n    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\nbe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\ncarnival which ends midday on February 27.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowings\nless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to\nWednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.\n    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131\nmln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs\nat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week\nstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451\nmln dlrs.\n    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February\n25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of\n644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.\n    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that\nthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve\nprojections in the week to Wednesday.\n    He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit\nstrangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been\npoor weather during the latest week.\n    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500\nmln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to\nnearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.\n    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s high\nfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s\nfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at\ntwo widely separated Fed districts.\n    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of\nadjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative\n750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for\nunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the\ncountry.\n    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two\ndifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securities\nand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or\n2100 EST on both days.\n    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during\nboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve\nimpact.\n    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount\nwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct\nby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional\ninstitutions.\n    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by\nthe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and\n15 pct by the smallest banks.\n    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess\nreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on\nFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average\ndeficit for the week as a whole.\n    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high\nexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at\nthe smallest banks.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on\nmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be\nconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the market\nvalue of its stock.\n    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the\nmarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command a\ngood market value, thereby boosting the total value of American\nExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\'\nmeeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management changes.\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof Shearson, according to analysts.\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\nAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.\nHe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\nprofitable securities firm.\"\n    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    But others believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he\nbelieves American Express could have considered a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place. Shearson\'s book value is in\nthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would\nprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market\ncapitalization,\" said Eckenfelder.\n    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since\nit plans to expand globally.\n    \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes\ncapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to\nenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the\nroad,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.\n    \"They\'ve outlined the fact that they\'re investing heavily\nin the future, which goes heavily into the international\narena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and\ndivestitures along the way,\" he said.\n    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the\nbrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might\nbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel related\nservices business.\n    \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure\nto brokerage. The value of the other components could command a\nhigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of\nthe total operating earnings of the company,\" he said.\n     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax\noperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

However, if it is determined that\ncertificates have caused the government grain stockpile to\ndecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.\n    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates\nprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.\n    But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire\nagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase\nin the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.\n    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,\nwhile USDA remains firmly committed to it.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 Liquefied natural gas imports from\nAlgeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its\neconomically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.\n    Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian\nstate petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in\nAlgiers that such imports would be made this year.\n    \"Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and\nthe time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay\nthe import until 1988/1989,\" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas\nanalyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.\n    Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former\ncustomers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary\nof Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials\ntold Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington\nNorthern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.\n    Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were\nfeasible. \"On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have\nmade capital investment to handle LNG import can operate\nprofitably even in the current price environment,\"  Frank\nSpadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.\n   Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports\non U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend\nhigher by the end of 1987.\n    A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of\nMexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm\nprices, Shearson\'s Tulis said.\n   In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of\nsupplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.\n    Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,\nsaying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.\n    Company sources also said that any negotiations with\nAlgeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate\nvolumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market\nvalues.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS Switzerland\'s economy, combining low\nunemployment, financial stability and a large external payments\nsurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory\nfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, OECD, said.\n    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight\nfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it\nsaid.\n    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out\nsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in\ninflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.\n    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product\ngrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986\nand a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after\nlast year\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\n    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate\nunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial\nnation OECD area.\n    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to\nthe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\nrespectively in 1986.\n    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP\nwould shrink in both years.\n    But \"given Switzerland\'s large external surplus, there\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\nGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\nimproving international balances,\" the OECD said.\n    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\n    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\nGDP, it added.\n    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\n    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment\ninvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year\nafter vigorous growth in 1986.\n    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for\ntourism and the banking industry, two major service sector\nearners of foreign exchange.\n    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the\naccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could\nlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.\n    Particularly for the banks, \"recent developments in\ninternational financial markets give rise to the question\nwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial\nflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed\nrequired ... To preserve its competitive position,\" it said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

One USDA official who took part in the\nconsultations this week described them as an exchange of \"calm,\nbasic, factual economics.\"\n    Another USDA official said there was \"not even an informal\nsuggestion or hint\" that the Soviets would live up to their\npledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were\ngranted more favorable terms.\n    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an\nEEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be\ndelayed because of disarray within the White House stemming\nfrom the Iran arms affair.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios\nseen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has\npushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean\nprocessing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean\nmeal and oil.\n    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the\nNational Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78\nmln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over\nthe past two months when crush margins surged to the best\nlevels seen in over a year.\n    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed\nsoybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the\nweekly crush number.\n    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,\nwith most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge\nin shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next\nfew months.\n    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed\ndemand is very light for this time of year due to the milder\nthan normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in\nan attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.\n    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent\nweeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the\nnearby March contract today.\n    \"Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold\nMay, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,\nwhich would cause March to gain on deferreds),\" one CBT crush\ntrader said.\n    \"But they\'ve been bailing out this week because the March\nhas been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not\ntomorrow, then later in the month,\" he added.\n    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush\nratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)\nfell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per\nbushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two\ndays.\n    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no\nprocessors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable\nlevel, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut\nback production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.\n    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid\npremiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.\n    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents\nfor every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down\nsharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below\nthe average cost of production, cash dealers said.\n    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with\nlittle talk of taking temporary down-time, so far.

'FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that\nthe central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of\npressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making\nmeeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.\n    \"The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we\ncan take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had\nchanged,\" said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.\n    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee\nlast Thursday that the Fed\'s policy \"has been unchanged up to\ntoday.\"\n    Although Volcker\'s statement last Thursday allayed most\nfears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on\nreserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted\nconfirmation of a steady policy in today\'s data, which covered\nthe two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.\n    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more\nacute by the Fed\'s decision yesterday to drain reserves from\nthe banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase\nagreements for the first time since April of last year,\neconomists added.\n    Today\'s data showed that the draining action was for a\nfairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.\n    \"The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively\nsizeable matched sales on Wednesday,\" said Dana Johnson of\nFirst National Bank of Chicago. \"But there was a clearly\njustified need for them.

'FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES France\'s right wing government is facing\ngrowing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising\ndown its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation\nforecasts for this year.\n    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector\nforecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation\nestimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its\neconomic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a\n2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last\nseptember.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures\nwould not push the government off its chosen mix of price\nderegulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.\n    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would\npush to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising\nthe spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.\n    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed\nPrime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth\nand rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,\nperhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential\nelections due by April 1988.\n    \"The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,\"\nsaid Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. \"We have the\nimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth\nthis year.\"\n    \"The big question is whether the government\'s policy of wage\nmoderation will be maintained,\" he added.\n    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout\n1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises\njustified by increased productivity.\n    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond\nMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already\nrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built\ninto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher\nprices.\n    Calling the government\'s policies \"unbalanced and unjust,\" he\nalso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\nmeasures to boost employment and training\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\nFrance\'s unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\nits top priority.\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\n    \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\nreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\nsaid.\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\n    \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\nall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\ncosts.\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\nas the government kept wages under control.\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\nhe added.\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\ndeficit, several analysts said.\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\nexpected growth, they said.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct\nin 1984.\n    The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible\nfor the slump.\n REUTER\n&#3;',1

'INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE Indonesia appears to be nearing a\npolitical crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected\neconomy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.\n    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has\nlaunched a series of measures over the past nine months to\nboost exports outside the oil sector and attract new\ninvestment.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading\nprimary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year\"s\nfall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its\ncurrency by 31 pct in September.\n    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto\"s\ngovernment appears to be divided over what direction to lead\nthe economy.\n    \"(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to\nderegulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,\"\nthe report says.

Economic\nactivity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export\nearnings from the petroleum industry.\"\n    \"Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak\ndomestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real\ndeclines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of\ngrowth in agriculture,\" the report states.\n    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is\ncrucial for the government to get the international lending its\nneeds.\n    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance\nof payments support was given partly to help the government\nmaintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

'GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS Gulf money markets have grown reasonably\nwell during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain\nto a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf\nInternational Bank BSC> (GIB) said.\n    The bank\'s economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf\ncapital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional\ninvestment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank\naccounts and precious metals.\n    \"Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with\nmore diversified capital market instruments and a change in the\ndisclosure requirements on company accounts,\" he said.\n    The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three\ncategories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.\n    Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of\nshort-term money market instruments and banks in the region had\nfloated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.\n    \"Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large\nextent, fragmented and lagging behind,\" he said.\n    Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans\nand bank facilities and very few companies had made use of\nstock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock\nexchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish\nexchanges.\n    But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf,\ngovernments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital\nmarkets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.\n    He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had\n\"clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital\nmarkets in the region.\"\n    In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,\nfinancial awareness among investors is still lacking and\ninvestment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack\ndepth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted\ninvestors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.\n    Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some\nGulf countries and authorities\' apparent reluctance to adopt\nfinancial innovations had also hampered capital markets.\n    He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation\nof joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.\n    Azzam said capital market instruments should be made\navailable to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi\nArabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been\ntaken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to\nown up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.\n    Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth\nfrom the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and\nthe expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi\nArabia.\n    But he added there is \"no bond market to speak of\" in Saudi\nArabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal\ndenominated bond issued in 1978.\n    While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading\nin Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal\nexchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent,\nAzzam said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

He did not elaborate.\n    Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in\nLagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its\nATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had\ndeclined due to poor demand and high production costs.\n    Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria\'s output was\nless than 1,000 tonnes last year.\n    ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries\'\nexport figures every three months using customs documents and\nmake projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to\nbe breached within the year-long quota period.\n    The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to\nbreach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.\n    They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil\ntheir quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other\nmembers at the ATPC\'s discretion.\n    The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated\n106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.\n    Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with\nthe ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes\nrespectively during the quota period.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
