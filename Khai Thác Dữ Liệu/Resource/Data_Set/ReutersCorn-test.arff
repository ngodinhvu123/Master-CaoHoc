But other businessmen said such\na short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\nfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n    \&quot;That is a very short-term view,\&quot; said Lawrence Mills,\ndirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n    \&quot;If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\nbe extended to other sources.

Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \&quot;They\&#39;ve made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit\&#39;s largely out of their hands,\&quot; said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo\&#39;s problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \&quot;The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\&quot; said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \&quot;U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\&quot; Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan\&#39;s\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \&quot;We need to find new business chances,\&quot; Komatsu said. \&quot;In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That\&#39;s the kind of deregulation we want.\&quot;\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \&quot;We don\&#39;t want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\&quot; he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \&quot;It\&#39;s (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\&quot; said\nKleinwort\&#39;s Smithson.\n    \&quot;After that, it\&#39;s a question of absorbing and juggling\naround.

Some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\&quot; National Australia Bank Ltd\neconomist Brian Hamley said.\n    \&quot;There is a \&#39;flight to quality\&#39;,\&quot; Hamley said. \&quot;Australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\&#39;t too\nmany other countries where you\&#39;d want to put your money.\&quot;\n    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n    \&quot;We\&#39;re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\nWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nU.S. Dollar,\&quot; Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\nsaid. \&quot;Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\&quot;\n    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \&quot;It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\&quot; Buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government\&#39;s promised tough\neconomic statement on May 14.\n    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \&quot;It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn\&#39;t considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\&quot; Buttrose said.\n    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \&quot;They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\&quot; Buttrose said.\n    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\nJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \&quot;eyes off\nthe yen\&quot; because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\nAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\nAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\nmarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\nweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\nequities, particularly in the gold sector.\n    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\ntoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\nthe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\nsame period.\n    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\ncompanies that have invested heavily in the United States in\nrecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\nestate, particularly in the tourism field.\n    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney\&#39;s five-star\nRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\nas indicative of the type of property being sought.\n    \&quot;They think they find good value real estate here which,\nwith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\ninvestment Australia needs,\&quot; Buttrose added.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks\&#39; shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\nGulf.\n    Kuwait\&#39;s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \&quot;real\&quot; budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \&quot;It depends on oil prices,\&quot; one said. \&quot;This summer is\nimportant.\&quot;\n    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

He quoted SMC\&#39;s chief financial director Ramon\ndel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\nboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\nsuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\nSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n    De los Angeles\&#39; earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\nlast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC\&#39;s Hong Kong\nsubsidiary &amp;lt;Neptunia Corp&gt; for a down payment on the shares.\nThe loan assumption was again ratified by last week\&#39;s board\nmeeting.\n    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\nresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\nApril 15.\n    \&quot;The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\na continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\nof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\ndisposition of the sequestered shares,\&quot; San Miguel Corp said in\na statement.\n    \&quot;Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\nreached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\npayment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\ngovernment\&#39;s expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\nof the controversy by April 15,\&quot; the statement added.\n    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\nCojuangco\&#39;s court petition, adding: \&quot;Any statement coming from\nus might be interpreted as adversarial.\&quot;\n    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\nsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\nto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\nStates citizen.\n    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \&quot;A\&quot; shares,\nwhich can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \&quot;B\&quot; shares which\nare available to foreign buyers.\n    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\nprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\nthe &amp;lt;A.Soriano&gt; group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\ninstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\nin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n    The sale was aborted when Diaz\&#39;s Presidential Commission on\nGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\nowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\nFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\nU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\nannounced last June.\n    \&quot;We have no objection to Soriano buying the \&quot;B\&quot; shares,\&quot; Diaz\ntold Reuters. \&quot;But everything is on hold now.\&quot;\n    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\nwould be resolved before the company\&#39;s annual stockholders\&#39;\nmeeting, scheduled for May 14.\n    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\npesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of\n700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

          <td id="LC131" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">&#39;ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\ndollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\npropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\nprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\nmajor company executives predicted.\n    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\nindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\nCorp &amp;lt;GAF&gt;, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\nto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\n    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &amp;lt;ASH&gt;, the\nKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\nmoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\n    \&quot;I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\&quot; said\nPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &amp;lt;DOW&gt;, adding,\n\&quot;There\&#39;s no major plant capacity being added around the world\nnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\nthe old ones.\&quot;\n    Analysts say the chemical industry\&#39;s biggest customers,\nautomobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\npaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\nproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\nmanaging director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\nfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\nby as much as 300 pct, he said.\n    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\nHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\nlast year and predicted it would have the best year in its\nhistory.\n    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\nand chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\ndollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \&quot;I believe the entire\nchemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\&quot;\nOreffice said.\n    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\nindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\nLast year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\ndlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\nindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\nplanning, said Pace\&#39;s John Dosher.\n    Dosher said last year\&#39;s fall in oil prices made feedstocks\ndramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\nwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\nU.S. chemical exports.\n    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\nbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\nmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\nin the early 1980s.\n    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\nhave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\nto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\nunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\nfriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\nUnion Carbide Corp &amp;lt;UK&gt;, recently offered three billion dlrs\nfor Borg Warner Corp &amp;lt;BOR&gt;, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\nand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &amp;lt;GRA&gt; \nhas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\nbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\nheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\nthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\nethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\nare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n    \&quot;Companies like DuPont &amp;lt;DD&gt; and Monsanto Co &amp;lt;MTC&gt; spent the\npast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\nchemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\ndeteriorated,\&quot; Dosher said. \&quot;But I think they will eventually\nkill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\nmarket.\&quot; Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n    \&quot;The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\ncarried away and repeating past mistakes,\&quot; GAF\&#39;s Heyman\ncautioned. \&quot;The shift from commodity chemicals may be\nill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\&quot;\n    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\nSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\nmln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\nof Dupont\&#39;s Conoco Inc\&#39;s chemical business, has spent 1.1\nbillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\nalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\n    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\nare the building blocks of specialty products.\n    \&quot;This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\nglamorous, high-margin business,\&quot; Cain said, adding that demand\nis expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\nplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\nand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\nbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\nU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

Morgan and Co Inc said its\nfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its\npreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual status\nits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.\n    That decision, spurred by Brazil\&#39;s suspension of interest\npayments on February 20, reduced the quarter\&#39;s net income by 20\nmln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the\nfirst three months of 1986.\n    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities\nunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln\ndlrs in the year-earlier period.\n    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading\nlosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and\nunderwriting of Euromarket securities.\n    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained\ndifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering\nheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether\nMorgan\&#39;s trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.\n    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan\nlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign\nexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and\ntrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.\n    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and\ncommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net\ninvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.\n    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell\nto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.\n    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means\nthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments are\nactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9\nmln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume\npayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\n    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan\&#39;s allowance for\ncredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\nwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\n    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\ncharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\nmln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\n    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter\&#39;s end were\n583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\nearlier.

The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do\nSul had between them 70 pct of the nation\&#39;s capacity, but were\nresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.\n    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West\ngrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage\ncapacity.\n    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and\nmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation\&#39;s grains\nproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.\n    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,\nthere is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to\nstoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for\nstoring loose grain, Brito said.\n    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the\ncrops.\n    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop\nhas been evident from television reports, which have shown\nenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,1</td>

Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\nMontreal-based Dominion called the report just \&quot;rumors.\&quot;\n    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\n    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\nthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\nBurlington actually came into play.\n    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\nadded credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\nwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\nand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\na U.S. acquisition.\n    A Dominion spokesman said Canada\&#39;s largest textile producer\nhas been negotiating with \&quot;many\&quot; U.S. textile companies, but\nwould not say whether Burlington was among them.\n    \&quot;There have been acquisitions in this area. It\&#39;s not\nunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\nhousecleaning they\&#39;ve done,\&quot; said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\nMcKinnon.\n    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\nand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs\nlast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its\noperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\ncompetition, Gormley said.\n    \&quot;They\&#39;ve pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\&quot;\nsaid Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\nfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\nand other fabric to the auto industry.\n    \&quot;In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\non the outlays they did make,\&quot; she said.\n    \&quot;You look at their record over the year, and I think\nthey\&#39;re poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\npast,\&quot; Gormley said.\n     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\nfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\nat its current levels.\n    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\nselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\ndlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\nbasis.\n    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\nplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\n    \&quot;After Asher\&#39;s (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\ndon\&#39;t find him very credible anymore,\&quot; said one arbitrager.\n    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\nmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\nhe doesn\&#39;t win the target company.\n    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\nStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying\nPonderosa Inc.\n    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with\nBurlington.\n    J.P. Stevens &amp;lt;STN&gt; climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest\nCannon Inc &amp;lt;FLD&gt;, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and\nCannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

          <td id="LC192" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">&#39;HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped\nto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to\nthe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite\ncontinuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts\nto extend world penetration.\n    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln\nguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.\n    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe\&#39;s\nleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,\nsaid sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.\n    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,\nWhere the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,\nwhere sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.\n    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker\nforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.\n    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the\nincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &amp;lt;El Aguila\nS.A.&gt; to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly\nin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken\&#39;s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe\&#39;s biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \&quot;We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\&quot; van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \&quot;The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\&quot; van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \&quot;This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\&quot; Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company\&#39;s seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\&#39;s\nmarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\nare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\nmoney.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

UAL last month said New York Real estate developer\nDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also\nheld discussions with its chairman.\n    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the\nposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.\n    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying\nUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2\nmln shares.\n    \&quot;United has got to consider this proposal. I think the\npilot\&#39;s proposal is realistic. I don\&#39;t exptect them to take it,\nbut it could put some interesting options in front of UAL\nmanagement,\&quot; said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.\n    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack\nwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz\nrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a\nstrategy to become a travel service company.\n    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union\nconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attention\non its airline.\n    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its\nnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.\n    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has\nbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100\ndlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as\nwidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe\nthe stock is in play.\n    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted\nattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a\ncatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps\nthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.\n    \&quot;The first domino is you have an investor with a\nconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That type\nof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\&quot;\nsaid Pettee.\n    \&quot;What\&#39;s interesting is the values are there.

But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar\&#39;s value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \&quot;If you don\&#39;t deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\&quot; Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment\&#39;s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \&quot;There\&#39;s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed\&#39;s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it\&#39;s not enough,\&quot; Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\&#39;s\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year\&#39;s figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\&#39;s end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year\&#39;s Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year\&#39;s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \&quot;For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you\&#39;re going to get\&quot; out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross\&#39;s Collander. \&quot;To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\&quot;\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \&quot;To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\nreduction level,\&quot; he explained. \&quot;Anything less than that will now\nlook like a failure to Wall Street.\&quot;\n    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\nlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\nbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\ndefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\nanticipated spending levels for next year.\n    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\nnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \ntaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

He added that West German growth forecasts would\nhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\nto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\nhad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\ninvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\ndetermined market trends.\n    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\ngrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\nwould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n    \&quot;In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity,\&quot; Koehler said.\n    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\nCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\ngoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\nrise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\nof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \&quot;Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\&quot; Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \&quot;In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\&quot; Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \&quot;the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\&quot; Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\nprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n    But many of the ministry\&#39;s actions are not unlike those of\nits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\nincluding Britain, several analysts said.\n    \&quot;The United States is really the odd man out,\&quot; Abegglen said.\n\&quot;For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\nin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\nview,\&quot; he said.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

He made clear that he was\nnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.\n    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar\ngained slight background support from the speculation.\n    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80\npct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money\nmarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may either\noffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate\nand let the strength of banks\&#39; demands set the allocation rate.\n    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less\nthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact\nexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could\nmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.\n    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative\ncapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of\nwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.\n    \&quot;In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity.\&quot;\n    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the\ngenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the\nfirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a\ncounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.\nREUTER^M\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\nwith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\nMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\nin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\nthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\npossibly to 140 yen.\n    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann\&#39;s view, saying he expects\na dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\nunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\nsentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\noperators to test the downside.\n    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\nWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\ncurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\nworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\nnear term, the traders said.\n    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\ncommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar\&#39;s\ndownward trend.\n    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\nfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\ndefend current ranges, which the communique said were \&quot;broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\&quot;\n    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n\&quot;They\&#39;re going to put somebody\&#39;s resolve to the test soon.\&quot; The\nU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\nunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\nEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\nmarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\n    Chase Bank\&#39;s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\nthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\nmarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\nvolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\n    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\ncommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\nfurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\n    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\n1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\naccord\&#39;s supposed currency target range.\n    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\nready for a period of \&quot;mainly sideways movement.\&quot;\n    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\ncontributing to greater stability.\n    \&quot;Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\nboost,\&quot; said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\nexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\nin the next three months.\n    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said\nthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations and\nshould not have produced disappointment.\n    \&quot;The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade\npolicies to redress current imbalances are of a different\ntimescale than currency markets operate on,\&quot; the source told\nReuters, \&quot;This is a political process which takes time.\&quot;\n    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in\nBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on\ncurrency markets today. \&quot;Did people really expect a patent\nremedy?\&quot; he asked.\n    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday\&#39;s meeting was only\nthe first in a series and said the market would watch carefully\nin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.\n    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was\nnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by\nJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could\nlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.\n    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in\npushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months\nwhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to\nsupport the Paris accord.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

The company said its\nrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a\nchange in accounting practice. It added that revenues would\nhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.\n    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly\ndue to its life insurance business.\n    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose\ndespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and\nhigher personal risks.\n    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage\ninsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.\n    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and\nlife insurance was lower.

Food and Agriculture Organisation\n(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to\nfall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.\n    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world\ngrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in\n1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet\nUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.\n    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to\nrise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the\nimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly\ndistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.\n    \&quot;Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially\non the outcome of this year\&#39;s harvests,\&quot; FAO said.\n    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at\na record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last\nseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986\nharvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.\n    FAO\&#39;s forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised\nupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of\nsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

The yen sank below 145 at one point\ndespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan\&#39;s Finance Minister, said the\nmovement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\nranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n    \&quot;I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\nseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\ndiscussions in Paris,\&quot; Miyazawa said yesterday.\n    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\nannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\nMiyazawa\&#39;s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday\&#39;s\nmeetings of leading industrial nations.\n    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n\&quot;extraordinary and urgent\&quot;, the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\nAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\nbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\nrepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\nfoster exchange rate stability.\n    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\nbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\ndollar\&#39;s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears. Monetary sources also said they understood that\nSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\nsuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday\&#39;s statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn\&#39;s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan\&#39;s trade surpluses and America\&#39;s\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \&quot;clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\&quot; he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo\&#39;s export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \&quot;norms\&quot; for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

They had hoped that new vitality in the\nindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\nprices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\nwith growing mounds of debt.\n    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\nthe industrial country economies would move up to an annual\ngrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\n    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\ntime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\nan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\n    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\nstates for markets for their products as well as financial\nassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations\&#39; \neconomies poses fundamental worries.\n    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\nonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\nincluding the key one of exports.\n    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\nhas served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\ntoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\n2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\n    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\nUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\nignite their economies but with little apparent success.\n    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\nthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\ndeficit.\n    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\nimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\nslower than expected.\n    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \&quot;it has\nto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\nwork through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\nto get a resonably complete effect.\&quot;\n    The report added, however, \&quot;the adjustments may take even\nmore time on this occasion.\&quot;\nREUTER^M\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

The government\&#39;s perceived need to control inflation by\nkeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\nspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\ngovernment\&#39;s target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n    Spain\&#39;s most closely-watched measure of money supply,\nliquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\npct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\ntarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\nrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n11.8 at end-1986.\n    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government\&#39;s call to\nhold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\nwith increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\nwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\nworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n    He said Spain\&#39;s current wave of strikes mainly affected the\nstate sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\npct wage ceiling.\n    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\nSpain\&#39;s foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\ntwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\nincrease over the corresponding period last year.\n    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\npeseta to correct the imbalance.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

          <td id="LC395" class="blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line">&#39;LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS Lead prices have risen this week against\na background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders\nsaid.\n    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying\nor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.\n    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at\na time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and\nprices tending to drift lower.\n    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low\nlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical\ndemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.\n    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be\nfelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,\nstocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders\nsaid.\n    The lower supply levels result from a number of different\nfactors around the globe.\n    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries\nbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish\nexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz\&#39;s smelter at\nLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant\nadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have\nbeen drawing on LME stocks.\n    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters\&#39; Port Pirie,\nSouth Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks\nfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meet\ncommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\nper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\nand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\nU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\na regular supplier to the world market.\n    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\nhave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\nquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\nin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\nfirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\norder was filled by merchants in March.\n    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\nthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\nestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\ndelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco\&#39;s Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run\&#39;s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda\&#39;s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at\nmidsession.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

VW\&#39;s group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and\nparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend\nan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has\nalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,\nwhich were issued last year. Analysts have described the held\ndividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.\n    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5\nbillion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment\non 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,\nsince the new capital was in preference shares.\n    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in\norder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At\nthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly\nless than three billion marks.\n REUTER\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

The important thing is that it\ncontinue year after year,\&quot; Lawson said.\n    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\nstabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\nweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\nthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\n    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\nthe Louvre accord, he said, \&quot;I don\&#39;t think so. If there had been\nno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\&quot;\n    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\nsaid, \&quot;the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n... but one has to be vigilant.\&quot;\n    He said yesterday\&#39;s G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n\&quot;current levels\&quot; of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n\&quot;carefully worded.\&quot; \&quot;We know what we mean, and we all mean the\nsame thing,\&quot; he said.\n    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\nmeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\nweakness for that agreement.\n    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa\&#39;s\npresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\ndomestic demand.\n    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\nincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\nalso involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\nthe second half of this year.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

April futures traded this\nmorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB\&#39;s\naverage price of 104 stg.\n    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is\na two-tier market for physical potatoes.

But lesser\nquality grades have traded below 100 stg.\n    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered\nagainst the April futures contract between now and the end of\nthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.\n    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management\ncommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice\nand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

They recommend taking profits.\n    \&quot;It\&#39;s that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\&quot; said\nCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \&quot;Orders will be\nstrong for about two months, and there are signs that some\n(order rates) are starting to dive already.\&quot;\n    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\nsome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\n&amp;lt;X&gt;, Bethlehem Steel Corp &amp;lt;BS&gt;, Armco Inc &amp;lt;AS&gt; and Inland Steel\nIndustries Inc &amp;lt;IAD&gt;.\n    \&quot;There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\nshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\nrising prices,\&quot; Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\nhowever, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\nmake them more efficient.\n    Despite his bearishness, Merrill\&#39;s Bradford continues to\nrecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\n    Armco\&#39;s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\nsheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\nhas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\nnoted. \&quot;It\&#39;s not a high-quality investment situation yet but\nthey\&#39;ve come a long way,\&quot; he said.\n    \&quot;We think the stock will do moderately better than the\nmarket,\&quot; he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\ncould go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\nbefore special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\nagainst losses last year.\n    Armco\&#39;s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\nsaid.\n    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \&quot;We had a buy\non it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\nit,\&quot; he said.\n    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\nshare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\nfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \&quot;But a lot\ndepends on oil prices,\&quot; he added. About 60 pct of USX\&#39;s sales\ncome from oil and natural gas.\n    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\nSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \&quot;The company\&#39;s done a lot\n(of restructuring), more than the market\&#39;s given them credit\nfor,\&quot; she said.\n    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\ntrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\nshare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n1986.\n    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\nbeen recommending the stocks since last November.\n    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\nalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\nthird quarter.\n    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \&quot;I think (steel)\nprices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\&quot;\nhe said.\n    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\ndropoff later in the year. \&quot;But there are more positives than\nnegatives,\&quot; she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\nindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\ncause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

This\nyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three\nweeks later than last year.\n    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said\nsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a\nseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted\n5.7 pct last year.\n    \&quot;The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate\nthat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear\nto be because liquidity and employment are rising,\&quot; said\nanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.\n    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in\naccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected\nto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986\&#39;s rise.\n     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\nitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\nanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\nholiday nears.\n    \&quot;Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\ncontinuing strength in the housing market,\&quot; said Edward\nBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &amp;lt;S&gt; which reported an\noverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women\&#39;s\nsportswear were also excellent.\n    \&quot;Sears\&#39; total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even\na modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment\ndue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\&quot;\nsaid C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. \n    J.C. Penney Co Inc &amp;lt;JCP&gt; and Dayton Hudson Corp &amp;lt;DH&gt; were\namong the weaker performers with comparable stores sales\ndeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney\&#39;s store and\ncatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson\&#39;s\noverall sales rose 4.8 pct.\n    Penney chairman William Howell said, \&quot;Sales continued\nstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from\nvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressed\nsouthwest.\&quot;\n    \&quot;Penney\&#39;s been shifting away from leisure time activity\nwear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,\nbut are currently hurting sales,\&quot; said Greenstein of Bear\nStearns.\n    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for\nthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \&quot;Hudson had a tougher\ncomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\&quot;\n    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower\nthan last year.\n    \&quot;Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are\nbeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales\nare coming through anyway,\&quot; said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.\n    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  \nbe better than he had originally expected in the beginning of\nthe year.\n    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of\nMay.\n     MARCH RETAIL SALES FOR MAJOR U.S. RETAILERS\n    STORE       PCT        1987       1986\n    SEARS       4.2     2.6 BIL       2.5 BIL \n    K MART      4.6     2.2 BIL       2.1 BIL \n    JC PENNEY  (1.3)    1.1 BIL       1.1 BIL \n    WAL-MART     32     1.1 BIL       855 MLN\n    FEDERATED   4.9     934 MLN       891 MLN\n    MAY         3.5     885 MLN       855 MLN\n    DAYTON      4.8     792 MLN       756 MLN\n    WOOLWORTH   0.2     591 MLN       590 MLN\n    ZAYRE      12.7     522 MLN       464 MLN\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>

Normally\nwhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of\nbeef exports,\&quot; one industry source said yesterday.\n     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \&quot;Depending on the\nseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then\ndecides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting\nbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension\non exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are\nstill awaiting their decision,\&quot; he added, asking not to be\nidentified.\n    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of\nhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had\nspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and\nupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.\n    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be\nforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low\nprices, the source said.

The\nstockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\nthe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\nand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\nmanagement was counter-productive, he said.\n Reuter\n&amp;#3;&#39;,0</td>
